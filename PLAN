section-name    project-belonged-to estimated-time  DDL #


## What I need:

1. the ability to **add** and **store** the sections
2. the ability to **print** the sections, more over, to print them as according to different **choices** (like by DDL, by project, etc.)
3. different **color** for different things (customized)
4. calculate whether I am able to do the things before DDL
5. an interactive UI like ikhal to modify the attributes
6. 


## How to build

Build it progressively

### First phase

give only primitive usages, able to store information and extract information, build the main frame




### Second phase 

build better UI
